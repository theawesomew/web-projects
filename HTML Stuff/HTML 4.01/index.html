				<p> HTML 4.01 is one of the oldest versions of HTML (HyperText Markup Language). It is the basis for the World Wide Web along with URL and HTTP. Webpages were made solely in HTML 4.01 for many years until the introduction of CSS and JavaScript. The introduction of these new technologies allowed websites to be better designed and more visually engaging and JavaScript began the immmersive interactivity that we associate with some of our most regularly visited sites. This site specifically is to see the effectiveness of the HTML 4.01 sites on users. This website has specifically ignored <b><i><a href='http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_frame.asp'>&lt;frame&gt;</a></b></i> because it's fucking painful and doesn't work on most modern browsers.</p>
